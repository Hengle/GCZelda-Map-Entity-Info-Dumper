# Map Entity Info Dumper

This should work on The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess for the GameCube. It may work on their Wii/HD equivelents, but one tests these things around here. It's a simple CLI tool which prompts you for a filepath of folders to check, and for whether or not it contains TP folders. 

Outputs a CSV to disk next to the executable containing which actors are in which map, what their names are, etc.
